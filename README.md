## Integration Tasks

### API Development:
Creating backend APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that define the protocols, data formats, and operations required for communication between different systems. This involves designing and implementing RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs, or other types of APIs based on the integration requirements.

### Data Transformation and Mapping:
Converting data formats, structures, and representations to ensure compatibility between different systems. This may involve transforming data from one schema to another, mapping fields between systems, or performing data validation and cleansing. ORMs are versatile as middlewares in ETL tasks.

### Message Queuing and Event-Driven Integration:
Implementing messaging systems and event-driven architectures to enable asynchronous communication and decoupling between components. This involves setting up message queues, event brokers, or publish-subscribe mechanisms to handle communication between systems.

### Security and Authentication:
Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access and data protection during integration. This may involve implementing OAuth, token-based authentication (JWT), or other security measures to authenticate and authorize requests - using SSL, Firewalls.

### Error Handling and Logging: 
Implementing error handling mechanisms to capture and handle exceptions, failures, and unexpected events during integration. This includes logging errors, generating error reports, and implementing retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.

### Contanerisation and Orchestration
For packaging services,maintaining consitency and deploying across environments as well as scaling.

### CI/CD and Integration Testing: 
Designing and conducting integration tests to ensure the seamless functioning and interoperability of integrated components. This involves testing data exchange, communication protocols, error handling, and overall system behavior.

### Monitoring and Performance Optimization: 
Setting up monitoring systems to track the performance, availability, and health of the integrated system. This includes monitoring API response times, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing system performance through caching, load balancing, or other techniques.
